# RTMP Video Streamer

This project provides a Python-based RTMP video streaming tool that allows users to stream local video files to an RTMP server using FFmpeg. Additionally, it includes functionality to preview the stream in real-time using FFplay.

## Features

- **Video File Selection**: Users can select a video file through a graphical file dialog.
- **Custom RTMP Server URL**: Users can input the RTMP server URL dynamically.
- **Real-Time Stream Preview**: The stream can be previewed in real-time using FFplay.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux (requires FFmpeg and FFplay installed).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg (including FFplay) installed and added to the system PATH
- `tkinter` library (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How It Works

1. The script prompts the user to select a video file using a file dialog.
2. The user is asked to input the RTMP server URL (e.g., `rtmp://127.0.0.1/live/stream_key`).
3. The video is streamed to the specified RTMP server using FFmpeg.
4. FFplay is launched in a separate thread to preview the stream in real-time.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure FFmpeg and FFplay are installed and accessible via the system PATH.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python streaming_rtmp_server_addRTMP_video_pop.py
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to select a video file and enter the RTMP server URL.

## Example

- **RTMP Server URL**: `rtmp://127.0.0.1/live/stream_key`
- **Video File**: Any supported video format (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`).

## Notes

- Ensure the RTMP server is running and accessible before starting the stream.
- FFplay is optional but recommended for real-time stream preview.
